This project is a System Verilog implementation of a MIPS processor, a widely-used architecture in computer systems. The MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) architecture is known for its simplicity and efficiency, making it a popular choice for teaching computer architecture concepts.

## Project Overview

The MIPS processor implementation in this project aims to capture the essential features of the MIPS architecture, including its instruction set, registers, and basic pipeline stages. 

## Processor Architecture

The MIPS architecture follows a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) design philosophy, emphasizing simple and fast instructions. 

## GitHub Repository

The source code and documentation for this MIPS processor implementation can be found on the GitHub repository [mips-processor](https://github.com/CgKaminski/toy-processors/mips-processor). Feel free to explore the code, simulate the processor, and learn about the inner workings of a MIPS architecture.
